        "This technique is different than many of the other machine learning techniques and has many applications in training agents (an AI) to interact with enviornments like games. Rather than feeding our machine learning model millions of examples we let our model come up with its own examples by exploring an environment. The concept is simple. Humans learn by exploring and learning from mistakes and past experiences so let's have our computer do the same.\n",

        "**Environment** In reinforcement learning tasks we have a notion of the enviornment. This is what our *agent* will explore. An example of an environment in the case of training an AI to play say a game of mario would be the level we are training the agent on.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Agent** an agent is an entity that is exploring the environment. Our agent will interact and take different actions within the environment. In our mario example the mario character within the game would be our agent.\n",
        "\n",
        "**State** always our agent will be in what we call a *state*. The state simply tells us about the status of the agent. The most common example of a state is the location of the agent within the environment. Moving locations would change the agents state.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Action** any interaction between the agent and environment would be considered an action. For example, moving to the left or jumping would be an action. An action may or may not change the current *state* of the agent. In fact, the act of doing nothing is an action as well! The action of say not pressing a key if we are using our mario example.\n",

If the agent were to perform an action which results in them losing score or possibly dying in the environment then they would receive a negative reward.\n",

        "Q-Learning is a simple yet quite powerful technique in machine learning that involves learning a matrix of action-reward values. This matrix is often reffered to as a Q-Table or Q-Matrix. The matrix is in shape (number of possible states, number of possible actions) where each value at matrix[n, m] represents the agents expected reward given they are in state n and take action m. The Q-learning algorithm defines the way we update the values in the matrix and decide what action to take at each state. The idea is that after a succesful training/learning of this Q-Table/matrix we can determine the action an agent should take in any state by looking at that states row in the matrix and taking the maximium value column as the action.\n",

As it starts to explore more of the environment it will start to gradually rely more on it's learned values (Q-Table) to take actions. This means that as our agent explores more of the environment it will develop a better understanding and start to take \"correct\" or better actions more often. It's important that the agent has a good balance of taking random actions and using learned values to ensure it does not get trapped in a local maximum.\n",

A high learning rate means that each update will introduce a large change to the current state-action value. A small learning rate means that each update has a more subtle change. Modifying the learning rate will change how the agent explores the environment and how quickly it determines the final values in the QTable.\n",
